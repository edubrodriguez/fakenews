            <p>The president has said it, pure and simple he just won.
            On the surface, such declaration is obvious, but the 
            election was not pure and simple.  New revelations from 
            apocryphal sources cast a serious doubt on our democratic 
            process, The Flake News has learned.  These revelations 
            show that a massive complot orchestrated by an obscure 
            conspiracy group know as “The Infuriaty”, paid millions 
            of dollars in Internet campaigns to discredit the electoral
            process.  The goal of such campaigns was to create a sense 
            of disbelief in voters, so they wouldn’t vote.  A source, 
            who declined to be identified, said that The Infuriaty 
            approached this person and offered ten million dollars to 
            create a website providing news that would achieve that goal.
            Another source, which only allowed us to use his profession, 
            he is a famous clown, told us that he was approached to become
            the face of the campaign.  He said he declined because our 
            democracy is so perfect that always the perfect candidate always
            wins.  At the end, our investigation suggests that the actions 
            by The Infuriaty had no effects on the electoral process.  
            Voters represented only a portion of the electorate, as usual, 
            but they were enough to decide the results.  The clown was right,
            the perfect candidate for that model won.  Despite this normal 
            outcome, we found out that The Infuriaty is believed to have 
            designed our democratic process, and that they were only testing
            their own electoral machine.  We can only assume pure and simple
            that it is working for them.</p><br>

            <p>The government is now blaming a so-called "portal in the Matrix" 
            for the alleged wiretapping to the President.  The intelligence 
            community has denied any knowledge of "something called Matrix", but
            declined an official response to media inquiries. <br>
                Government officials, and members of the official party on the 
                other hand, demanded an investigation.  At a press meeting, the
                President mentioned he felt troubled by the news.  When several
                reporters pressed him for a more direct answer, he stated that 
                the information was provided to him directly by a source he 
                called, "the lady Oracle", but declined to specify more on the 
                issue or the identity of this source.  The President left abruptly
                due to a medical problem, but a spokeperson said that it was only
                because he needed to take his daily pills.  Apparently, he had 
                forgotten if the pills he needed where the red or the blue 
                ones.</p>

            <div>
            <p>The Statue of Liberty may be gone soon if an immigration court 
            decision stands.  The Court decided to deport the statue back to France 
            after attorneys for the government declared in the court 
            that there wasn't any proof that the statue was in the country
            legally.  The City is appealing the decision to a superior court stating
            that after all these years in national soil, the statue must be allowed
            a recognition of citizenship.  If the Court decision favors the City, 
            there are already plans for a fireworks party and an official 
            naturalization ceremony.
            On the other hand, if the Court keeps its current deportation decision,
            the statue must be retuned to France, and government officials said 
            that they will hold a deportation party, also with fireworks.  The 
            French government hasn't release a statement yet, but the conservative
            party declared that they don't want any symbol of immigrants in their
            country, and therefore the statue should be sent elsewhere.</p>

                    <p>The government is happy, jobs are everywhere.  The recent
                    official job report shows that everyday people are employed.  
                    We decided to go to the streets and ask around opinions on 
                    the job report.  When we asked people about the positive results in the 
                    report, they say they believe them as four out of five said to be 
                    employed recently.  On the other hand, when we asked them 
                    about their salaries, they sais that they were not getting paid.
                    According to them, it is a new government policy, get hired today
                    and maybe get paid later.</p><br><br><br>

                    <p>The gorvernment is no longer interested in having
                    a health care system for all.  The new policy, which soon
                    will be presented in Congress, is a a 
                    do it yoursel helath system.  This new proposal estimates 
                    that millions of syringes will be distributed accross the
                    country along with a medicine that cures everything.
                    In this new system all you need to do is obtain both, applied
                    it yourself, and then forget about it.  In fact, some 
                    proponents of the policy within the administration, have 
                    promoted the name "Forget About It Care!" as the official name.
                    We askked the President, but all he responded to us was, 
                    "forget about it".</p><br>

                    <p>Area 51 is gone.  China bought the ultra secret
                    extrarestial base and now it is located in Northern
                    China.  Everything that was in that base has been 
                    shipped out to that country, including alien 
                    ships, and the recuperated corpses of the aliens that
                    crashed in Roswell in the 50's.  All that is left where
                    the base was located is an inmense desert.  The good news
                    according to intelligence sources closed to the 
                    president is that the money from the purchase will be used
                    to build a wall that impede the presence of the other 
                    "aliens".</p><br><br><br>
